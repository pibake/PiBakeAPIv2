# Contributing

Thank you so much for viewing this file! If you can read this, you probably want to contribute. Right now,
we are looking for some Go developers to help us out. 

Go is pretty stuctured already but we have a few guidelines to help us out. 

## Guidelines

* `struct`'s live in its own sperate file
* Each API call lives in its own seperate file
* Each call is exported (each function signature is in `PascalCase`)
* More guidelines will be posted here

## Stuff I have to do

I have some stuff I want to do to this RESTful API. The following are those things:
* Logging is a must (probably `lumberjack`)
* Sessions? 
* Allow a certain number of HTTP requests for a certain length of time (5 requests/min per machine?)

If you are a Go developer and want to knock these out, send in a PR!
